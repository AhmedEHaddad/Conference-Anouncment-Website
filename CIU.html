				<p>Cyprus International University ….a truly International experience.

						CIU Philosophy Cyprus International University is a modern campus University based in the suburb of Haspolat on the outskirts of Nicosia, the capital city of Cyprus. At the corner stone of three continents and rich in terms of history and culture, North Cyprus, the pearl of the Mediterranean, offers a truly international experience.
						
						Our mission is to create a truly international experience by developing and disseminating universal knowledge, for the benefit of all society. Much of this is achieved by publishing academic research of an international standard and by specializing in innovative research relevant both locally in North Cyprus and globally.
