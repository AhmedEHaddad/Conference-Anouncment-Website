Term Project
>2018-19 Spring<
• Page 1: Homepage
You need to provide general information about the conference details and some attractive images as a home page.
• Page 2: CIU
Design a page with general information, description and images for CIU and its facilities.
• Page 3: Registration
Design a page for calculating the registration cost of the conference with the selected sessions, participant type and number of days selected for conference attendance. You can take the below Registration Cost Calculation table as a reference to design it.
• Page 4: Contact Us
User should be able to fill the contact form and system should validate each form element.

Registration Cost Calculation
o User should be able to select multiple sessions with checkboxes and participant type with radio buttons.
o Use a drop down menu for number of days that a participant will attend for the conference.
o Total cost should appear after no. of days selected in a confirmation message, in which the message will ask if the user will accept the calculated cost to pay or not. In case of acceptance; a thank you message will be alerted, otherwise a registration withdraw message will be alerted.
o Cost: The cost for attending to the conference varies; 100Euros for authors and 200Euros for audiences per day. So, in order to calculate the cost of a participant, you need to multiply the price of the participant type with the number of days that s/he will attend for sessions.
o Total Cost: Note that, a participant can select more than one session. Hence, the total cost is the summation of cost of each session. If the cost is more than 800Euros apply 10% discount (cost*0.10).
